<h2>Larry Kwong History </h2>

<img src="pop.jpg" width="200px">
<p> Larry Kwong was born in 1923 in Vernon, British Columbia.

Kwong had practiced ice hockey on frozen ponds in Vernon but had not played a game of organized hockey until he joined the Vernon Hydrophones when he was 16 years old. Kwong carried the Hydrophones to thye Provincial Juvinail title in 1941. At just 18 years old Kwong made a semi profesional team, the trail Smoke Eaters 
and in 1942 the Chigago Blackhawks invited him to a training camp, but the Canadian government refused to process the documentation needed to leave the country. Larry Kwong was drafted into the Canadadian army in 1944 but instead of going overseas to fight he was selected to play on the Red Wheelers of the central Alberta Garrsion Hockey League. After the war Kwong retured to the 
Trail Smoke Eaters and won the provincial senior hockey championship with them in 1946. Later in 1946, a New York Rangers scout was so impressed with Kwongs abilitys that he sighned him to the New York Rovers, a farm team of the New York Rangers. Kwong scored a goal in his debut for the Rovers against the Boston Olympics on October 27, 1946.
